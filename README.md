## The Farty Unicorn


## Project Description

Our inaugural group project at <Academia de Código_>#63 & #66 Bootcamp in Lisbon. With just 2 and a half weeks of Java learning under our belts, we embarked on the challenge of creating a game from scratch. Our deadline for project deployment: 10 days, all while attending daily 8-hour lectures.

## The Idea

Our concept was to craft an arcade-style game inspired by Flappy Bird, but with a twist – the protagonist would be a unicorn! To propel the unicorn forward, the player would make it fart, complete with amusing sound effects, adding a comedic element to the game.

The player's task is to guide the unicorn, which continuously moves to the right, through pairs of randomly placed pipes with identically sized gaps. The unicorn descends automatically and ascends only when the player presses the space bar – and in this game, the space bar means farting!

In our second mode, "Shootable," the unicorn wields a machine gun to shoot down enemies, symbolized by our daily student presentations at the academy. And, because our unicorn isn't all rainbows and sweetness, it's also a fan of the movie "Die Hard," sprinkling in references to some of the film's most iconic quotes.

## Development

We commenced by defining our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and designing a suitable UML diagram. We established a Git repository to track our project's development. Initially, we divided tasks among group members, but later, we adopted pair programming to collaborate more efficiently. Finally, as we brought all the components together, we added finishing touches like audio enhancements, improved graphics, and an introductory menu.
